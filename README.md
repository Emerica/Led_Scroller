LED scroller - IR automated programming<br/>
Canadian Tire Led scroller special. Pita to program with the remote. Not so much with a robot.<br/>

I've added my digispark version as well incase it helps.<br/>
Things are a little messy, but should give you a starting point.<br/>


Looks like I had the shield wired with an IR emitter from pin 3 with a 100ohm resitor to Gnd<br/>
